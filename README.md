## About project :wave:

**Black-lives-matter** has been a mobile responsive web application that helps people in danger. 
The idea is to build a web based application using concepts of Network Analysis and Web.

The application has features like:

- Reporting the live location to neraby police station
- An alert message to the family memners
- An alert message to the community or NGO
- Police Siren sound
- Direct mailing system to the community or NGO or police station 

## Why Black-lives-matter :question: 

<img src="https://github.com/tharun143/Black-lives-matter/blob/master/images/maxresdefault.png" alt="George Floyd" align="left" width="200px" height="auto">
Recently, **George Floyd** , a 46-year-old African American man, died in Minneapolis on Monday while he was being restrained by the police. Video footage of the incident, which was broadcast by the media and went viral on social media platforms, showed an officer kneeling on Floyd's neck as he gasped for breath. 

After listening to this miserable and horrible incident I came up with a thought of implementing an application for the people who are in danger. This is a tribute to **George Floyd** :disappointed:
